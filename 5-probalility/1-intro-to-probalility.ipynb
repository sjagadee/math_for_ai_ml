    "#### Events and Sample Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a fair coin, which is equally likely to come up heads (H) or tails (T).\n",
    "\n",
    "In instances like this, where the two outcomes are equally likely, we can use probability theory to express the likelihood of a particular **event** by comparing it with the **sample space** (the set of all possible outcomes; can be denoted as $\\Omega$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes of event}}{\\text{Number of outcomes in }\\Omega} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're only flipping the coin once, then there are only two possible outcomes in the sample space $\\Omega$: it will either be H or T (using set notation, we could write this as $\\Omega$ = {H, T}).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore: $$ P(H) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equally: $$ P(T) = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a separate example, consider drawing a single card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In this case, the number of possible outcomes in the sample space $\\Omega$ is 52.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one ace of spades in the deck, so the probability of drawing it is: $$ P(\\text{ace of spades}) = \\frac{1}{52} \\approx 0.019 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast there are four aces, so the probability of drawing an ace is: $$ P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} \\approx 0.077 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional examples:\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{spade}) = \\frac{13}{52} = 0.25 $$\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{ace OR spade}) = \\frac{16}{52} \\approx 0.307 $$\n",

    "#### Multiple Independent Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to coin flipping to illustrate situations where we have an event consisting of multiple independent observations. For example, the probability of throwing two consecutive heads is: $$ P(\\text{HH}) = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$ ...because there is one HH event in the sample set of four possible events ($\\Omega$ = {HH, HT, TH, TT}).\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the probability of throwing *three* consecutive heads is: $$ P(\\text{HHH}) = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125 $$ ...because there is one HHH event in the sample set of eight possible events ($\\Omega$ = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}).\n",
    "\n",
    "As final examples, the probability of throwing exactly two heads in three tosses is $ P = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $ \n",

So the probability of throwing five consecutive heads, for example, is the product of probabilities we've already calculated: $$ P(\\text{HHHHH}) = P(\\text{HH}) \\times P(\\text{HHH}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32} \\approx 0.031 $$"

We can use **factorials** (e.g., $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$), which feature prominently in combinatorics, to calculate probabilities instead of painstakingly determining all of the members of the sample space $\\Omega$ and counting subsets within $\\Omega$."

    "The left-hand side of the equation is read \"$n$ choose $k$\" and is most quickly understood via an example: If we have three coin flips, $n = 3$, and if we're interested in the number of ways to get two head flips (or two tail flips, for that matter), $k = 2$. We would read this as \"3 choose 2\" and calculate it as:\n",
